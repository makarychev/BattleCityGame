# BattleCityGame

One of the 90s unforgettable games, Battle Tank (only 1st level) is ready with Qt framework. 
Most of us might fight with enemy tanks to protect our castles during our childhood.

It's first attempt at writing with Qt QML 2.0.
I will appreciate if you find out mistakes, bugs etc., and write feedback!

## Compiling

```sh
$ qmake -project
$ qmake
$ make
```
